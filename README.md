## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. MongoDB
3. Python 3.10+
4. For mobile development:
   - Android Studio (for Android development)
   - Xcode (for iOS development)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aradhana-portfolio.git
cd aradhana-portfolio
```

2. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the backend directory:
   ```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```
   - Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/aradhana-portfolio
   EMAIL_USER=your.email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install

   # Install mobile app dependencies (optional)
   cd ../mobile
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   mongod

   # On macOS/Linux
   sudo service mongod start
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Web: Open http://localhost:3008 in your browser
   - API: Running on http://localhost:5001

### Running the Mobile App

1. For Android:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected
   cd mobile
   npm run android
   ```

2. For iOS:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you have Xcode open and an iOS simulator running
   cd mobile
   npm run ios
   ```

### Building for Production

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Build the mobile app:
   ```bash
   # For Android
   cd mobile
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease

   # For iOS
   cd mobile/ios
   xcodebuild -scheme AradhanaPortfolio -configuration Release
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. If you encounter MongoDB connection issues:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Verify the MONGODB_URI in your .env file
   - Check MongoDB logs for errors

2. If you encounter npm installation issues:
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Remove node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules`
   - Reinstall dependencies: `npm install`

3. If you encounter CORS issues:
   - Ensure the frontend is running on the correct port
   - Verify the backend CORS configuration
   - Check your browser's console for error messages
